# Coders League Constitution

This is the Coders League Constitution for Berkeley City College.

Instead of making changes to the constitution via amendments, we opted for using revisions instead. This means you'll be able to make as many changes as you want to the constitution, and then submit the revision to Coders League as a proposed revision. We'll vote on it, and if it passes, we'll push the revision to master, where we will have the entire revision history tracked.
